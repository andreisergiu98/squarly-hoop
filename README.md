# squarly-hoop

Simple bullet hell rhythm game.

## Getting Started

If you're comfortable getting up and running from a `git clone`, this method is for you.

### Requirements

* You must have git installed
* You must have gcc installed
* You must have cmake installed
* You must have sfml installed
* You must have boost installed
* You must have [fmodex api](http://www.fmod.org/download-previous-products/) installed

### Building
1. `git clone https://github.com/andreisergiu98/squarly-hoop.git`
2. `cd squarly-hoop`
3. `cmake CMakeLists.txt -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
4. `make`

### Running
1. `cd bin`
2. `./squarly-hoop`

### Error
If the app is not opening it should display the error in the terminal, though the only
reason for it not to open is having the music folder empty.
