# squarly-hoop

Simple bullet hell rhythm game.

## Getting Started

If you're comfortable getting up and running from a `git clone`, this method is for you.

### Requirements

1. You must have git installed
2. You must have gcc installed
3. You must have cmake installed
4. You must have sfml installed
5. You must have boost installed
6. You must have [fmodex api](http://www.fmod.org/download-previous-products/) installed

### Building
1. `git clone https://github.com/andreisergiu98/squarly-hoop.git`
2. `cd squarly-hoop`
3. `cmake CMakeLists.txt -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
4. `make`

### Running
1. `cd bin`
2. `./squarly-hoop`

### Error
If the app is not opening it should display the error in the terminal, though the only
reason for it not to open is having the music folder empty.
